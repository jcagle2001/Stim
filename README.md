### Description
Stim is a program that plays a tone on a user-specified interval. Do you have a speaker or sound bar that enters power-saving mode if no audio signal has been sent to it for a while? Stim keeps your speakers alive by sending a tone to them periodically. The included file is an inaudible 4hz tone that is enough to keep the speakers from shutting down, but not be distracting or obnoxious.

The following tone intervals can be set:
- 30 seconds
- 45 seconds
- 1 minute
- 2 minutes
- 3 minutes
- 4 minutes
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes

The user can select between the normal, inaudible tone (4hz) or an audible test tone. A visual representation of whether or not the clip is playing is displayed in the tray menu.

### Known Issues

- The tray menu will persist if nothing is clicked inside the menu. Workaround: click the status indicator to exit the menu.
