# Stim

Stim is a program that plays a tone on a user-specified interval. Do you have a speaker or sound bar that enters power-saving mode if no audio signal has been sent to it for a while? Stim keeps your speakers alive by sending a tone to them periodically. The included file is an inaudible 4hz tone that is enough to keep the speakers from shutting down, but not be distracting or obnoxious.
